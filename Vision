Here is the refined logic for the Global Board, the UI Layout, and the updated Coding Prompt.1. The Match Screen: "The Synchronized Roll"Instead of a literal dice, we use Color Synchronization to signal a match.Top Half (You): Your screen starts cycling through a spectrum of colors rapidly.Bottom Half (Stranger): Shows a "Searching..." animation with a blurred, cycling color.The Match: When the server pairs you, both halves "snap" to a solid, vibrant color (e.g., both turn Emerald Green or Electric Blue). The vibrations stop, and the UI transitions into the Table View.2. UI Layout: The "Mirror" TableThis is the core workspace. It needs to be distraction-free.ElementDescriptionHeaderCategory (e.g., Politics) and Timer (keeps the conversation focused/urgent).Column Left"Common Ground" (Green tint). Shared truths found during the talk.Column Right"Points of Friction" (Red tint). Respected differences.Center GutterA thin line where the AI Pulse lives. It glows as you type.Chat OverlayA small, bottom-anchored text input. As you type, the AI Redaction happens live.The AI Pulse & Redaction LogicThe Blink: While typing "I disagree because...", the border of your input field pulses Red. If you type "I see your point on...", it pulses Green.The Redaction: If you type "You are an [idiot]," the recipient sees "You are an [REDACTED]" immediately, even before you send. This lowers the "heat" of the conversation in real-time.3. The Global Common Board: "Humanity’s Ledger"We don't want to just archive chats; we want to show what the world actually agrees on.The Handshake: At the end of a session, both users are presented with the list of "Commonalities" they wrote. They both tap "Publish" on the ones they feel are most important.Aggregation: If 1,000 pairs across the world agree that "Healthcare is a human right," that statement grows larger/bolder on the Global Board (like a Word Cloud).The Visualization: A scrollable "Wall of Unity" categorized by topic. Users can see that even in "War" or "Politics," there are 50 things everyone agreed on today.4. The Updated Coding Prompt

Prompt:"Build a real-time React Native app called 'Common Ground' with a focus on two-user anonymous collaboration.1. Matching UI (The Color Roll): > - Create a landing screen split horizontally into two equal squares.The top square (User) and bottom square (Waiting/Stranger) should cycle through hex colors rapidly ($100ms$ interval).Implement a WebSocket listener: when a 'match' event is received, both squares must stop on the same random color and vibrate the device briefly before navigating to the 'Table View.'2. Table View (Live 2-Way Editor):Create a split-view table with two columns: 'Commonalities' and 'Differences.'Use a real-time sync engine (like Supabase Realtime or Socket.io). Both users must be able to type into any cell.Ensure 'Optimistic Updates' so there is zero lag when a user types in a cell.3. AI Pulse & Redaction Engine:Integrate a sentiment analysis function. As the user types in the chat input, change the border color: Green (Positive), Red (Negative), Blue (Neutral).Implement a live 'Redaction' filter. Create a blacklist of profanity. If a word matches, the recipient's screen must display a black rectangle [████] instead of the word, updated on every keystroke.4. Global Board Logic:Create a post-session screen where users 'Upvote' their shared commonalities to a 'Global Board' database table.Please provide the file structure, the socket logic for the color-roll, and the shared table component."

CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE INSTRUCTION: > Do NOT use an online database (Firebase/Supabase) yet. Implement all data handling using Local State (React Context/Redux) or a Local DB (SQLite/WatermelonDB).1. The 'Ghost' Bot Engine:Create a 'Simulation Mode' where the app mimics a second user.Program 3 distinct Bot types:The Agreeable Bot: Randomly adds positive statements to the 'Commonalities' column.The Contradictory Bot: Adds opposing views to the 'Differences' column.The Toxic Bot: Attempts to type profanity to test the Live Redaction Engine.2. Matching UI (The Color Roll):Create a landing screen split horizontally into two squares.Top square (User) cycles colors. Bottom square (Simulated Match) cycles colors.After a 3-second 'search' delay, snap both to the same color and trigger the session.3. Split-Table UI (Local Sync):Create the 2-column live table.The 'Bot' should 'type' into the table with a randomized delay to simulate a real human.4. AI Pulse & Redaction Logic:Write a local function to simulate sentiment analysis. If the input contains words like 'agree', 'yes', or 'same', the border glows Green. If it contains 'no', 'disagree', or 'wrong', it glows Red.Implement the Live Redaction: Any word from a local CONST_PROFANITY_LIST must be rendered as a black block [████] in the 'Bot's' view of the chat.Please provide the code for the Bot Logic Controller and the Main Table Component first."2. Refined Feature: The "Bot Persona"To make the local simulation useful, the bots shouldn't just be random text generators. They should help you test the UX of the 2-column table.Bot NameBehaviorWhy we test this?"Mirror"Repeats what you say but in different words.To see if the "Commonalities" column gets cluttered."The Devil's Advocate"Always finds a "Difference" for every "Commonality" you type.To test the layout when one column is much longer than the other."The Silent Observer"Types very slowly and mostly stays Neutral (Blue).To test the "Pulse" animation and user patience.3. Global Common Board (Local Version)Since we aren't using a cloud DB yet, the "Global Board" will function as a Personal Session History.Session Summary: After the bot-chat ends, the app saves the table to local storage.The "Humanity" Mock-up: I recommend having the AI generate a "Mock Global Board" file—a static JSON list of 50 commonalities (e.g., "Most people believe in kindness")—so you can visualize how the final product will look when it's populated by thousands of users.4. Technical Strategy: Local RedactionFor the redaction to feel "Live," we use a Regex Listener.Logic: As the "Bot" sends a string to the UI, the UI runs:text.replace(/badword|toxicword/gi, '████')Performance: Because it's local, the lag will be zero, giving you a baseline for how fast the "Real" cloud version needs to be.

In the end, door open, 2 columns open as a door. telling the person their stand on the topic. like or dislike or neutral. after the timer ends. can they have a 5 minute conversattion with a person?
